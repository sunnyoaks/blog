## Hei!

Anna (33)- moved from Poland to Norway when I was 3 and the Berlin wall fell.

Got a restless in my twenties, moved around. Lived in St. Petersburg, Lisbon and New York. Still loves being a country girl. The smell of forests, rose gardens and cut wood makes me feel at home. I blogged for a while over [here](https://librasmoments.blogspot.com/).

I have a slight addiction to perfumes, art supplies and that perfect cup of cortado in the morning. Other than that, I am constantly trying to get better at conciously spending my time, money and attention. Sometimes with varying success â€“ but hey. We are all just people!
