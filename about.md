Anna (33)- moved from Poland to Norway when I was 3 and the Berlin wall fell.

Got a restless when I was in college, so I moved around a little. I lived in St. Petersburg, Lisbon and New York. I am still very much a country girl at heart. The smell of forests, rose gardens and cut wood makes me feel at home. I blogged for a while over [here](https://librasmoments.blogspot.com/), but so many things happened in my life that I decided to start a new space here. 

Now I live and work as a designer in Oslo. I have a slight addiction to perfumes, art supplies and I love a cup of cortado in the morning. Other than that, I am constantly trying to get better at conciously spending my time, money and attention. Sometimes with varying success â€“ but hey. We are all just people!
