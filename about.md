Anna (33) moved from Poland to Norway when I was 3 and the Berlin wall fell.

Got restless in Norway, moved around. Lived in St. Petersburg, Lisbon and New York. Just to find out I am a country girl at heart. The smell of forests, rose gardens and cut wood makes me feel at home.

I have a slight addiction to perfumes, art supplies and that perfect cup of cortado in the morning. Other than that I enjoy my trying to be conscious about spending time, money and attention.
