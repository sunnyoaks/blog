Today is an aftermath. An aftermath following a weekend with many difficult emotions taking place among people I had no choice than to be around. I looked forward to go back home. I thought I would feel exhilaration about walking through the door of my apartment, knowing I finally would be in my own space.

Then when I actually unlocked my dor, dropped by suitcase and crashed on my sofa I realized not even that made me feel good. It made me feel worse than when I was enduring my stay. It was like the burden and the strength in my heart dropped at the same time. And my heart poured rage and guilt subsequently. 

All of a sudden I felt as if the world would be closing me in with a lot of expectations that I wouldn't be equipped to handle. And it made me want to ask everyone to go f*** themselves.  I also acted, something I am not so very proud of, passive aggressive towards someone. And it has all happened before. Many times.

When you can't snap back, what do you do? As one of my
[favorite writers](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/152342-pain-reaches-the-heart-with-electrical-speed-but-truth-moves) says:

"Pain reaches the heart with electrical speed, but truth moves to the heart as slowly as a glacier."

I think she means: you wait and you watch. 

After three attempts of writing this post I ended up with what I think is a kinder version of what I wanted to say. Part of me I just wanted to complain. Another part wanted so badly to accept feeling terrible so I could move on. And the reason why I couldnâ€™t do the last was because I focused to much on the moving on and too little on what the pain really meant. The glacier has yet to be discovered. 

But the aftermath was a nice reminder to strive for moments of silence and presence. Note to self: start meditating again.
