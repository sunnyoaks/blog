What better way relax in the spring sun than to discover blooming treasures in the Botanical Garden? My little flat in Oslo is located right next to it, which makes anytime a good time for a brief visit. But warm April days are simply the best for it.

The park is about to be covered by fields of spring flowers.

_The greenhouse has a jungle with exotic plants that bloom all year. It is nice to come here in February too. Just to get a little warm._
