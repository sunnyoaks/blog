What better way relax in the spring sun than to discover blooming treasures in the Botanical Garden? My little flat in Oslo is located right next to it, which makes any time a good time for a brief visit. But warm April days are simply the best for it.

 And the best thing: there is no entrance fee! Happy Sunday ^^
