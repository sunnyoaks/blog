It feels a little surreal that I am soon to finish my third gratitude journal. Keeping them has been such a rewarding journey.

I started my first journal the summer of 2017. I was ready to put some serious effort into becoming and staying happy. I got myself an empty Moleskine (just to get a little fancy) and  named it “Gode ting” in Norwegian - “Good Things”. Since then I  sit down on my bed (almost) every evening, and try to write down at least three good experiences that have happened during the day. At first it felt almost as brainwashing myself, and every effort to find good things felt forced.  

Within the next eight months my first Moleskin was packed. On most days I had at least 5-7 memorable experiences to note, everything from the smallest impression, to big milestones at work or personally. Now, being on my third journal, it is rewarding to flip through the earlier ones and remind myself of so many nice things. I think that keeping a gratitude journal  must have been the best thing I have ever done for myself. 

My “Good things” journal helped me searching positive experiences, but also helped me stay positive during difficult times. Practicing it on those days and overcoming difficult experiences matters immensely. 

And isn't it wonderful how sometimes the simplest things can put a smile on your face. Here are some spring highlights from my journal:

##### March 18th 2018

* I moved the last stuff from my old apartment with the help of Ingvild, my childhood friend. What a relief it is to finally be completely done with the move. And what I relief it was to know I was never alone in this process.
* I followed my mom’s advice and made myself a nice hot chocolate. But a healthy version with almond milk and honey. 
* The weather has shifted, and it feels like spring is really here.

##### April 13th 2018
* It is Friday again! Yay!!!
* My colleagues gave me really nice feedback on a presentation. It was improvised as I did not have time to prepare it and felt very nervous about it. Supposedly I managed to communicate clearly and made the topic sound interesting. 
* I finally started learning French on Duolingo again. Why was I overthinking it so much before? It is so much fun!

##### April 28th 2018

* How nice it is to start a new project at work. It feels so fresh and motivating.
* I visited an old friend in the evening and we chatted about absolutely everything.  
* I had the loveliest long walk back home. The sky was pink and blue, and the clouds were gorgeous, almost foggy formations.
