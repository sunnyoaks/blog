##### Nice things to do in Janury

1. Spend an afternoon at the swimmingpool with a close friend. 
2. Go out for drinks and disco dancing with your sweetheart.
3. Spend a Sunday outdoors in the snowy forest. Then enjoy a long, hot shower at home.  
4. Start an online course on something you love to learn more about. (I started this [this illustration course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-graphic-illustration-v/sessions/what-is-good-illustration)).
5. Buy yourself the year's first bouquet of tulips. A little reminder of sunnier days to come.   

Last week went from tiresome and sad to full of laughter and good experiences - something I truly needed. Energy levels are elevated and I am starting this week with full force. Wishing all out there a lovely week!
